ConstructName,NameType,0,n,"A name for the ControlConstruct. May be expressed in multiple languages. Repeat the element to express names with different content, for example different names for different systems.",,,,,,,,,,,ddi:datacollection:3_3,e,
Label,LabelType,0,n,"A display label for the ControlConstruct. Supports multiple language versions of the same content as well as optional formatting of the content. Repeat for labels with different content, for example, labels with differing length limitations.",,,,,,,,,,,ddi:reusable:3_3,e,
Description,StructuredStringType,0,1,A description of the content and purpose of the ControlConstruct. Supports multiple language versions of the same content as well as optional formatting of the content.,,,,,,,,,,,ddi:reusable:3_3,e,
InParameter,InParameterType,0,n,A parameter that may accept content from outside its parent element.,,,,,,,,,,,ddi:reusable:3_3,e,
OutParameter,ParameterType,0,n,An identify for the output of the control construct.,,,,,,,,,,,ddi:reusable:3_3,e,
Binding,BindingType,0,n,"A structure used to bind the content of a parameter declared as the source to a parameter declared as the target. For example, binding the output of a question to the input of a generation instruction. Question A has an OutParameter X. Generation Instruction has an InParameter Y used in the recode instruction. Binding defines the content of InParameter Y to be whatever is provided by OutParameter X for use in the calculation of the recode.",,,,,,,,,,,ddi:reusable:3_3,e,
ExternalAid,ExternalAidType,0,n,"A pointer to an external aid presented by the instrument such as a text card, image, audio, or audiovisual aid. Typically a URN. Use type attribute to describe the type of external aid provided. Example of terms to use would include: imageOnly audioOnly audioVisual multiMedia. ExternalAid will be available each time the control construct is invoked. Care should be taken when placing an ExternalAid in RepeatWhile, RepeatUntil and Loop constructs as it will recur each time the conditional statement is checked. This does not include interviewer instructions, which are handled separately.",,,,,,,,,,,ddi:datacollection:3_3,e,
ExternalInterviewerInstruction,ExternalInterviewerInstructionType,0,n,Contains a reference to an interviewer instruct ruction held in a structure other than DDI XML. Uses the OtherMaterial structure to describe and link to the external object.,,,,,,,,,,,ddi:datacollection:3_3,e,
InterviewerInstructionAttachment,AttachedInstructionType,0,n,an interviewer instruction expressed as DDI XML.,,,,,,,,,,,ddi:datacollection:3_3,e,
DevelopmentResultsReference,DevelopmentResults,0,n,Reference to the development implementation results which gave rise to this version of the object. TypeOfObject should be DevelopmentResults.,,,,,,,,,,,ddi:datacollection:3_3,e,
