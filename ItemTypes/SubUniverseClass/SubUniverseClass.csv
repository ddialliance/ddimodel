UniverseReference,Universe,0,n,"A reference to a universe contained in this SubUniverseClass. Note that two different parent universes may contain references to the same universe within a sub-universe group. For example, the Universe ""Population of Europe"" and the Universe ""Population of the United States"" may both have a reference to the SubUniverseClass with the defining concept of Gender and member Universes ""Males"" and ""Females"". The SubUniverseClass is ALWAYS a restriction of its parent universe so that in one case it would be ""Males within the Population of Europe"" and in the other usage ""Males within the Population of the United States"". A question or variable should reference each relevant universe to define the appropriate intersect group.",true,,,,,,,,,,ddi:reusable:3_3,e,
