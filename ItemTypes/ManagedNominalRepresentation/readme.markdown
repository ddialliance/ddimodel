A means of capturing the features of a nominal (marked/unmarked) response domain. Note that this is not the same as a code or category list with a yes/no set of responses. This representation is generally used in QuestionGrids when defining the response domain of a grid cell. In addition to the basic objects of a representation, the structure defines the allowed content of the mark using a regular expression.
