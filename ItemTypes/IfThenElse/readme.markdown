A member of the ControlConstruct substitution group. Describes an if-then-else decision type of control construct. IF the stated condition is met, the THEN clause is trigged, otherwise the ELSE clause is triggered. Contains an IfCondition (the condition that must be met to trigger the Then clause), a ThenConstructReference (indicating the construct to invoke if the condition is met), an ElseConstructReference (indicating the construct to invoke if the condition is not met), and an ElseIf structure allowing the expression of multiple conditions to invoke multiple branching.
