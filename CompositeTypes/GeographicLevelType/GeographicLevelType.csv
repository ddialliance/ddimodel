GeographicLevelName,NameType,0,n,"A name for the GeographicLevel. May be expressed in multiple languages. Repeat the element to express names with different content, for example different names for different systems.",,,,,,,,,,,ddi:reusable:3_3,e,
Description,StructuredStringType,0,1,A description of the GeographicLevel. Supports multiple language versions of the same content as well as optional formatting of the content.,,,,,,,,,,,ddi:reusable:3_3,e,
GeographicLevelCode,CodeValueType,0,n,A code and its authorization source for identifying the level within a specific system.,,,,,,,,,,,ddi:reusable:3_3,e,
CoverageLimitation,InternationalStringType,0,1,"Describes a limitation of the coverage such as all objects of a specific type that meet population size requirements (i.e., All Places with a population of 10,000 or more).",,,,,,,,,,,ddi:reusable:3_3,e,
PrimaryComponentLevel,PrimaryComponentLevelType,0,n,"Provides references to the base level elements that are used as building blocks for composed geographies. For example, Metropolitan areas that are composed of counties except in the New England States where they are composed of county subdivisions, or School Attendance Boundaries (SABINS) built from Census Blocks. This structure allows for specifying the basic building block for composed areas and any restrictions (coverage limitations). The field may be repeated to provide alternate information on the basic building blocks for areas outside of the coverage limitations described.",,,,,,,,,,,ddi:reusable:3_3,e,
ParentGeographicLevelReference,GeographicLevelType,0,n,Reference to a single containing (parent) geography.,,,,,,,,,,,ddi:reusable:3_3,e,
IsExhaustiveParentGeographicLevel,boolean,0,1,Indicates whether the geographic level completely fills its parent level. Counties are exhaustive within States. Places are NOT exhaustive within States.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
GeographicLayerBaseReference,GeographicLevelType,0,n,"Use for geographic polygons that are the result of layering two or more geographic hierarchies where the polygon being described is the intersect of the layers. For example: State - County - County Subdivision - Place/Remainder - Tract [The portion of a tract that is within a single place (or non-place area) and a single county subdivision] This polygon is made by overlaying the following three geographic hierarchies: 1) State - Place, 2) State - County - Tract, and 3) State - County - Subdivision. The three GeographicLayerBase elements would point to Tract, Place, and County Subdivision.",,,,,,,,,,,ddi:reusable:3_3,e,
